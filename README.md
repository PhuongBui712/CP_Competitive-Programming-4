# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING 4
## Author
I am Bui Tan Phuong - a student of HCMUS (Ho Chi Minh University of Science)

## Inspiration
With a passion for competitive programming problems and Data structure & Algorithm knowledge, I bought a couple of books about competitve programming which was Competitive Programming 4. In this repository, I'will solve and update problems in the book continually.

## About books
Competitive Programming 4 is one of the best book about CP concept by Steven Halim, Felix Halim, and Suhendry Effendy. More information about this book is [here](https://cpbook.net/).

***Note:*** I don't advertise the books, I just want to share a good book to everyone want to learn about competitive programming.
